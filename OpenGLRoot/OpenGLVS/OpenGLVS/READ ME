=== Info ===
This program was built in visual studio.


=== COMMANDS ===
Commands are invoked by having the program window selected and pressing one of the following keys on your keyboard.
Prompts and inputs will show up in the console window.

Key Command List:
    S - Save the cloth mesh to a .obj file (Utilizes the mesh state in the current frame)
    L - Load a .obj file from the current working directory

    UP_ARROW,DOWN_ARROW,LEFT_ARROW,RIGHT_ARROW  - Rotate the scene view


    Simulations:
        0 - Empty Sim Environment
        1 - Simulation Scenario 1 (SS1): a square piece of cloth floating horizontally in the air at first, 
            which then free-falls onto a sphere on the ground.
        2 - Simulation Scenario 2 (SS2): a square piece of cloth floating horizontally in the air first, then
            free-falling with two adjacent corners fixed in the space.
        3 - SS1 with the sphere rotating in-place round the Y axis (up-axis) and friction between the sphere
            and the cloth.
        4 - SS2 with wind blowing.

        5 - A square piece of cloth floating horizontally in the air first, then free-falling with
            four corners fixed in the space.
        6 7 8 9 - A square piece of cloth floating horizontally in the air first, then free-falling with
                  all edges of a side fixed in the space. (6: 1 Side, 7: 2 Sides, 8: 3 Sides, 9: 4 Sides)

    Alter Environment:
        P - Pause/Play the current simulation.
        
        A - Toggle axis.

        W - Toggle wind         (modelled as a steady force in a fixed direction).
        R - Toggle wind realism (introduces some variation to the wind strength on the cloth mesh).

        G - Toggle ground.

        C - Toggle sphere.
        X - Toggle sphere rotation.
        < > - Slow down / Speed up sphere.
        [ ] - Slow down / Speed up simulation.

        + - - Increase/Decrease cloth length
        / * - Increase/Decrease cloth width





=== INTERFACE ===
When running the program, a small grid should be visible, with an axis at the center.
Use the key commands to run defined simulations or load objects into the scene.

Wind - A pink line drawn form the origin is used to indicate the strength 

Note, when saving and loading files, you are not required to enter the .obj file extension.
